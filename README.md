# Purpose
The purpose of this build was to use tools given to us in class to create a planner that was responsive to time that would save inputs in local storage. We were given a css file to create timeblocks in our html. After that we created a js file to run the functions of the page. 



# Criteria
1. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

2. User is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.

3. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

4. User is able to enter text in timeblock.

5. When save button is clicked, the text is stored. 

6. When the page is refreshed, the saved data is available to the user.
